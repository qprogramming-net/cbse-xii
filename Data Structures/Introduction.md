# Introduction to Data Structures

A data structure is a data collection with well defined operations and behaviour or properties.

We will be looking at two data structures:

1. Stack: A linear structure implemented in the LIFO (Last in First Out) manner where insertions and deletion are restricted at one end - the top.

   It is a dynamic data structure as it can grow or shrink

2. Queue: A linear dynamic structure following the FIFO (First In First Out) rule.
