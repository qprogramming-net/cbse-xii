## Reading a File

- Using r, r+, w+, a+ mode

### `.read()` method

- Reads a specified number of bytes of data
- **Syntax:** `file.read(n)`, where `n` is the number of bytes to read.
- In ascii, **each character is stored as one byte**, so n also represents **number of characters**

**Example:**

```python
with open("file.txt", "r") as file:
	content = file.read(5) # first five bytes of data
```

If a **negative** number or no number is given for `n`, it reads *all* of the data:

```python
with open("file.txt", "r") as file:
	content = file.read() # all data
```



### `.readline(n)` method

- Reads `n` characters in one complete line until end of line, indicated by \n character

```python
with open("file.txt", "r") as file:
	content = file.readline(10) # first 10 characters
	print(content)
```

When we run the code the output will be `Hello Worl` since those are the first 10 bytes in the file

If no argument is provided, the entire line is read.

```python
with open("file.txt", "r") as file:
	content = file.readline()
	print(content)

# if first line is "Hello World!", the output would be "Hello World!" and a blank line due to \n
```



### `.readlines()` method

- Reads all lines with \n and returns a **list** of strings of each line
- \n at end of each string in the list
- If we give a number as argument, it acts as a character count.

Let's suppose we have the following file `file.txt`:

```
Hello World!
How are you?
```

We create the following program:

```python
with open("file.txt", "r") as file:
	content = file.readlines()
	print(content)
```

The output will be:

```
['Hello World!\n', 'How are you?']
```

We can split the lines using `.split()` to get individual words:

Using the file in previous example, we can print output line by line using `.splitlines()`

```python
with open("file.txt", "r") as file:
	content = file.readlines()
	
	for line in content:
		print(line.split())
```

The output will be:

```
['Hello', 'World!']
['How', 'are', 'you?']
```

Using the file in previous example, we can print output line by line using `.splitlines()`

```python
with open("file.txt", "r") as file:
	content = file.readlines()
	
	for line in content:
		print(line.splitlines())
```

The output will be:

```
['Hello World!']
['How are you?']
```

### Program to display properly line by line

```python
with open("file.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.readlines()
    
    for line in content:
        print(line.strip("\n")) # removes trailing \n
```

The output will be:

```
Hello World!
How are you?
```
