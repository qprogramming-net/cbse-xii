# Setting Offsets

Offsets help us use the position of the pointer in the file.

## `.tell()`

Specifies the position in the file

```python
with open("file.txt", "r") as file:
	print(file.tell()) # returns byte position
```

The output will be `0` as read mode opens the file at the start.

## `.seek()`

Moves pointer to particular position

```python
file.seek(<offset>, <reference point>)
```

The reference point can be:

**0:** beginning
**1:** current position
**2:** end of file

**The default is 0**

**Example**

We have a file `file.txt` with the following contents:

```
Hello World!
How are you?
```

Let's run the following code:

```python
with open("file.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read() # moves cursor to end of file when finished
    print(file.tell())

    file.seek(0) # moves to beginning of file
    print(file.tell())

    file.seek(10) # moves to 10th byte from beginning
    print(file.tell())
    
    file.seek(0,2) # moves to end of file (0 bytes from end)
    print(file.tell())
```

We will get the following output:

```
26
0
10
26
```
