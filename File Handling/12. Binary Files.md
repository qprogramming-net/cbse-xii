# Binary Files

## Binary File Operations

- **Serialization** is the process of **transforming** data or an object in the memory (RAM) to a stream of **bytes** called **byte streams**.
- These byte streams in a binary file can then be stored in a disk or in a database or sent through a network.
- Serialization process is also called **pickling**.
- **De-serialization** or **unpickling** is the inverse of pickling process where a byte stream is **converted** back to a Python object.
