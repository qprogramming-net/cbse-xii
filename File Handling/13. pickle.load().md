### `load()`

- Used to unpickle/deserialize
- Syntax: `pickle.load(file)`

```python
import pickle

with open("file.dat", "rb") as file:
	data = pickle.load(file)
```

The `data` variable is assigned the data stored in the binary file and it can be a list or tuple etc. in the format Python stores them as.

If there are multiple objects stored together, for example, `[1,2,3,4][4,5,6]`

We can use `while` to get all the data:

```python
import pickle

with open("file.dat", "rb") as file:

    # runs until end of data
    try:
        data = pickle.load(file)
        while data:
            print(data)
            data = pickle.load(file) # try to load file

	# EOFError occurs when file ends but we try to retreive data from it
    except EOFError:
        print("Done Reading")
```

The output of this program will be:

```
[1, 2, 3, 4]
[4, 5, 6]
Done Reading
```

Each time the loop runs, the program loads an object until the loop terminates.
