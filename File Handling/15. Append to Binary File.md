## Append

Let's say we want to make a binary file with multiple records. To accomplish this we will use the binary file in append mode, `ab`.

Let's say I want to append the following records for a student database:

```
{"roll": 1, "name": "A", "marks": 95}
{"roll": 2, "name": "B", "marks": 92}
{"roll": 3, "name": "C", "marks": 81}
{"roll": 4, "name": "D", "marks": 85}
```

I can write the following program to input the data for each record and append individual records to our binary file. Remember, binary files can store all kinds of data such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, etc.

```python
import pickle

with open("students.dat", "ab") as file:
    to_continue = "y" # variable to check if you want to continue adding data
    while to_continue == "y":
        
        # record dictionary
        record = {}
        
        # fields to fill
        rollno = int(input("Enter Roll Number: "))
        name = input("Enter Student Name")
        marks = int(input("Enter Marks:"))
        
        record["roll"] = rollno
        record["name"] = name
        record["marks"] = marks
        
        pickle.dump(record, file)
        
        # check if user would like to continue entering data
        to_continue = input("Would you like to enter more data? If yes, enter y, else n: ")
```

Now, enter the data and it will be appended to the file.

Here are the steps we used:

1. Create file in append mode
2. Create input fields
3. Append the object for each record to the binary file
