In the last example, we added records to a student database. Let's now see how we can access data of a particular student.

We know our binary file stores multiple objects and we also know how to load multiple objects.

Let's make a program to print the names of students scoring above 90 in the exam:

```python
import pickle

with open("students.dat", "rb") as file:
    
    # we use exception handling to catch errors in loading data
    while True:
        try:
            record = pickle.load(file)
            
            if record['marks'] > 90:
                print(record['name'])
        except EOFError:
            pass            
```

Output:

```
A
B
```

We can use this method to get any kinds of data we want.

Here are the steps we use:

1. In a try - except block, load the file once
2. If the file is not empty, loop through each object and check the required condition
3. When the file ends, exit the loop and program

The following is another example, where we make a function to get the details of a student by their roll number:

```python
import pickle

def get_details(rno):
    with open("students.dat", "rb") as file:

        # we use exception handling to catch errors in loading data
        while True:
        	try:
            	record = pickle.load(file)
                if record['roll'] == rno:
                    print("Name:",record['name'], "Marks:",record['marks'])
                    return # exit function
                
            except EOFError:
                print("Roll no. not in database")   

get_details(2)
get_details(5)
```

The output will be:

```
Name: B Marks: 92
Roll no. not in database
```
