## Update

Let's say we now want to update the data for a record.

We will follow the following method:

1. Find record to update
2. Make changes in loaded record
3. Write back to the the file at the location of the record

Here is where our offsets come into play. Before we load the next object, we can get the current location using `file.tell()`. This will give the starting location of the next object. We store this position and then, if we come across the record to change, we set our cursor to the starting point using `file.seek()` and then overwrite the previous data. The following example will make it easier to understand:

Let's add 2 marks to student C's score:

```python
import pickle

with open("students.dat", "rb+") as file:
    while True:
		
        try:
            pos = file.tell() # starting position
       		record = pickle.load(file)
            
            if record['name'] == "C":
                record['marks'] += 2
                
                # move to starting position of the record
                file.seek(pos)
                pickle.dump(record, file) # overwrite data
               	
                # exit loop when the record is updated
                break
               
    	except EOFError:
        	break # exit loop if file ends
```

This will add 2 marks to student C's score.

There is a second way to do this as well - write new content to another file, delete original file, rename new file to old file:

```python
import pickle
import os

with open("students.dat", "rb+") as file:
    with open("students2.dat", "wb") as file2: # open second file
        
        while True:
            try:
                record = pickle.load(file)
                if record['name'] == "C":
                    record['marks'] += 2

                pickle.dump(record, file2)
                
            except EOFError:
                break # exit loop at end of file
                
# make sure to change file properties once the files have been closed i.e. outside with

# remove original file
os.remove("students.dat")

# rename new file
os.rename("students2.dat", "students.dat")
```

The second method is more reliable.
