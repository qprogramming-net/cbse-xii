## Write to File

### Writer object

In order to write to a CSV in the required format, we need to create a writer object:

```python
import csv
with open("file.csv", "w", newline="") as file: # opening in write mode
    writer = csv.writer(file)
```

Thus, `writer` is assigned a `csv.writer` object with which we will be able to write to a CSV using the two methods discussed below.

Notice that we added a value for the `newline` parameter. This was done because different operating systems (Windows, MacOS, etc.) have different end of line (EOL) sequences. By removing the default escape sequence in our code, we make it accessible on all devices and prevent a blank line between records. Try removing this in your code and see how the output changes.

#### Writer Methods

1. `.writerow()`

   - Used to write **one** record (row) to a CSV.
   - It takes a sequence as an input and separates each element in the sequence by the delimiter (by default a comma) in the file

   **Example**

   ```python
   import csv 
   with open("file.csv", "w", newline="") as file:
       writer = csv.writer(file)
       
       data = ["Col1", "Col2", "Col3"]
       
       writer.writerow(data)
   ```

   When we execute this program, we generate a csv file, `file.csv` with the following content:

   ```
   Col1,Col2,Col3
   ```

2. `.writerows()`

   - Used to write multiple records to a CSV
   - Takes a 2-dimensional nested sequence (sequence within a sequence)
   - Each sequence within the parent sequence represents a record
   - Fields in each record are separated by the delimiter when written to the file

   **Example**

   ```python
   import csv 
   with open("file.csv", "w", newline="") as file:
       writer = csv.writer(file)
       
       data = [["Col1", "Col2", "Col3"], ["1", "2", "3"], ["4", "5", "6"]]
       
       writer.writerows(data)
   ```

   When we run the program we get a file with contents as show below:

   ```
   Col1,Col2,Col3
   1,2,3
   4,5,6
   ```
