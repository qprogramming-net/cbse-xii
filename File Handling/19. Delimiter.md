### Delimiter

The delimiter is simply the character that fields in a record are separated by. By default, the delimiter for CSV files is a comma, but we can also change it to tab, "|", etc.

**Example**

```python
import csv 
with open("file.csv", "w", newline="") as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file, delimiter="\t") # \t represents tab space
    
    data = [["Col1", "Col2", "Col3"], ["1", "2", "3"], ["4", "5", "6"]]
    
    writer.writerows(data)
```

When we run the program we get a file with contents as show below:

```
Col1	Col2	Col3
1	2	3
4	5	6
```

As you can see, each fin a record has been separated by a tab space. Thus, the `delimiter` parameter for the `csv.writer` object is the character which separates field in a record.
