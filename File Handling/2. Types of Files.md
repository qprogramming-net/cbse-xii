# Types of Files

### Text Files

- Stores data as binary, but we see decoded text
- Can be opened in text editor eg. Notepad
- Each line has an end of line (EOL) character (default is \n)
- Contents separated by whitespace, comma or tab (\t)
- Examples: `.txt` files, `.py` files
- Python has **inbuilt** file object methods to work with such files (`read()`, `write()`, `.readlines()`, etc.)

### Binary Files

- Stores data as binary and original raw form
- A single change to the binary file can corrupt it
- Difficult to remove errors since we cannot understand it
- Not readable by humans
- `.dat` , `.bin` file extension
- We use the `pickle` module in Python to work with such files

### CSV Files

- One type of text file
- Includes multiple rows known as **records**
- Each element in a row is separated by a comma (or a different **delimiter)**
- `.csv` file extension
- We use the `csv` module in Python to work with such files

CSVs can be represented as tables as well:

|              | Field 1 | Field 2 | Field3 |
| ------------ | ------- | ------- | ------ |
| **Record 1** | R1, F1  | R1, F2  | R1, F3 |
| **Record 2** | R2, F1  | R2, F2  | R2, F3 |



### Differences Between Files

| Factor                | Text                                              | Binary                                                       | CSV                                                          |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Use**               | Stores sequence of unicode characters             | Stores large files such as images and videos as the raw bytes | Stores data in the form of a table with records (rows) and columns (attributes) and each element in a record is separated by a delimiter (by default a comma) |
| **Extension**         | .txt, .py                                         | .dat, .bin                                                   | .csv                                                         |
| **Human Readability** | Readable                                          | Not Readable                                                 | Readable                                                     |
| **Python Support**    | Inbuilt methods and functions                     | pickle module                                                | csv module                                                   |
| **Speed**             | Slower                                            | Faster                                                       | Slower                                                       |
| **EOL**               | Every line ends with EOL which is `\n` by default | No EOL                                                       | Terminates a line automatically when the delimiter is not used after data. |
