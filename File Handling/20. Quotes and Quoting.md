### Quotes

Quoting is putting characters before and after each field in a record, similar to quotes ' '. We can specify the quote character as well as kinds of field to quote.

#### `quotechar` 

This parameter decides the character that acts as a quote

**Example**

```python
import csv 
with open("file.csv", "w", newline="") as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file, quotechar="|", quoting=csv.QUOTE_ALL) # don't worry about quoting yet
    
    data = [["Col1", "Col2", "Col3"], ["1", "2", "3"], ["4", "5", "6"]]
    
    writer.writerows(data)
```

When we run the program we get a file with contents as show below:

```
|Col1|,|Col2|,|Col3|
|1|,|2|,|3|
|4|,|5|,|6|
```



#### `quoting`

This parameter decides which kinds of data to quote i.e. it tells the program to quote only elements in a record of a certain kind. To specify which kinds of elements to quote, there are predefined constraints:

1. `csv.QUOTE_ALL`: To quote each and every field in the data
2. `csv.QUOTE_MINIMAL`: To quote fields containing the **delimiter**, **quotechar** or EOL character (eg \n) (see previous pages)
3. `csv.QUOTE_NONNUMERIC`: To quote all text data and convert all numeric data to float
4. `csv.QUOTE_NONE`: To not quote fields (default)
