## Read File

### Reader Object

Similar to the `writer` object, we create a `reader` object to read a CSV

```python
import csv 
with open("file.csv", "r", newline="") as file: # opening in read mode
    reader = csv.reader(file)
```

The great thing is that we do not need to use any methods to work with the reader object since `csv.reader()` returns a list of lists where each nested list represents a record in the CSV and each element within this list represents the value of a particular field/attribute in that record. 

You can think of it as the reverse of `writerows()` since it writes a nested list to the file, whereas `reader()` returns a nested list.

Therefore, assuming we have added the following contents to the file `file.txt`:

```
Col1,Col2,Col3
1,2,3
4,5,6
```

we can print the data record by record:

```python
import csv 
with open("file.csv", "r", newline="") as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file)
    
    for record in reader:
        print(record)
```

The output will be:

```
['Col1', 'Col2', 'Col3']
['1', '2', '3']
['4', '5', '6']
```



If we make a modification, so that each individual item is separated by commas:

```python
import csv 
with open("file.csv", "r", newline="") as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file)
    
    for record in reader:
        print(",".join(record))
```

In this case, the output will be:

```
Col1,Col2,Col3
1,2,3
4,5,6
```
