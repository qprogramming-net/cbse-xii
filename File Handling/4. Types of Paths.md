## Types of Paths

### Absolute Path

The path starting from the **drive** (C:, D:, E:, etc)

Let's say we have a set of folders in the order:

``` 
C: > user > qprogramming > documents > file.txt
```

The absolute path to this file would be `C:\\user\\qprogramming\\documents\\file.txt`

We can also use single `\` instead of `\\`, but in Python we may come across a case wherein a single dash plus a character could represent an escape sequence.

Example:

```python
"C:\users\qprogramming\documents\total.csv"
```

We know that `\t` is used for a tab space so it might cause an error if we use such a path in our string, we can put an "r" before our string which tells the interpreter to only use the **raw** string and ignore special sequences:

```python
r"C:\users\qprogramming\documents\total.csv"
```



###  Relative Path

The relative path of a file is the path relative to the current working directory.

To use a relative path we have to keep in mind two symbols: 

1. Single Dot ("."): Represents the current working directory (CWD)
2. Double Dot (".."): Represents the directory containing the current working directory (parent directory)

Let's understand with the help of an example:

If we are in the directory:

```
C:\users\qprogramming\documents\
```

Our CWD is this path and we represent it by `.` 

The path to the parent directory is `C:\users\qprogramming` and we represent it by `..`

So, if we want to use a file `test.txt` located in the directory`C:\users\qprogramming\documents\files` directory, we use the path `./files/test.txt` to access the file.

If the file is located in `C:\users\qprogramming\` , we can use the path `../test.txt` to access the file.
