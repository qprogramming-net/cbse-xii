### `with` clause

- **Advantage:** don't have to close file as it is automatically closed after the code within the `with` has been executed
- Memory efficient
- Simpler syntax

**Syntax**

```python
with open(filename, mode) as file:
	<code>
```

Here, the `file` variable is still assigned a file object.

In conclusion, to open a file we need to specify its path as well as the mode we want to open it in.
