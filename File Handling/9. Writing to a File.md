## Writing to a File

### `.write()` method


- Writes string to text file
- To go to a new line, we need to add "\n" at the end of each line in the string

Let's make a file `file.txt`:

```python
with open("file.txt", "w") as file:
	string = "Hello World!\nHow are you?"
	file.write(string)
```

When we run the code, we get the following output in `file.txt`:

```
Hello World!
How are you?
```

In reality, `.write()` writes to a buffer and the content is only added to the file when the file is closed.

You should also known that this method returns the number of bytes written to a file.



### `.writelines()` method

- Writes multiple strings
- Have to pass iterable like list, tuple, string

Let's create the same file again with this method:

```python
with open("file.txt", "w") as file:
	lines = ["Hello World!\n", "How are you?"]
	file.writelines(lines)
```

When we run the code, we get the following output in `file.txt`:

```
Hello World!
How are you?
```

Note that you have to add \n at the end of every line barring the last one, if you want each element in the list to go to a newline.

**Key Point:** `.write()` returns number of characters written, `.writelines()` does not.
